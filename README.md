# Deep_learning--fashion-mnist-style-detector
ðŸ§¥ Fashion Image Classification using Deep Learning on Fashion MNIST Dataset.

# Problem Statement:
```
The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model capable of accurately classifying grayscale images of clothing items from the Fashion MNIST dataset into predefined categories such as shirts, sneakers, trousers, and dresses. The model should learn visual patterns and textures that distinguish one category from another, achieving high accuracy and robustness against variations in clothing style, shape, and lighting.
```
ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
```
- Preprocess and visualize the Fashion MNIST dataset.

- Build and train a neural network (CNN or ANN) for image classification.

- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

- Deploy the trained model using Streamlit or Flask for interactive prediction.
